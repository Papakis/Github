We need more people to interview. Can we manage this ?

We want a functionality to create a repository either public or private or the user will go directly through the GitHUB?
Find this repository either through exact name or by partial match (autocomplete perhaps?)
Possibility to create collaborators for public Repos or organizations for private 
Students will be able to give access to professors (This can be achieved by Github )
